# Udemy-CSS101-Project
CSS101 project for Full-Stack Web Development course via Udemy

Project was to create a web page containing a navigation bar, logo, links, and background image. I love tacos so I created a fun (and helpful!) site to search for tacos near me, taco recipes, and the history of tacos. Because who doesn't love tacos?
